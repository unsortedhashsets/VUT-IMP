Simple tachometer
============================

Application description
=======================

An application implements a simple tachometer, rotor rotation was emulated with manually pressing the selected buttons on the kit. Speed (presses) per minute prints on the terminal and shows on the kit display.

Description of control
======================

In addition to the standard Fitkit commands, a single "help" command has been added to display usage information. To start the measurement, just needed to start pressing the keys - the supported keys of the fitkit keyboard are: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,*,#.

Wiring diagrams of external peripherals with the kit
====================================================

No external periphery

Photographs showing the proposed external / auxiliary devices, or information on specific kit settings
======================================================================================================

No external periphery. No special settings.

Final summary
=============

In my opinion, the task is completed. After stopping the translation rotation of the rotor (new clicks), the rotor will gradually stop to a state of rest before starting the measurement without additional 'reset'. Inaccuracies in the operation of the tachometer and insufficiently large separation of values are possible, the required separation was not defined by the task.
